# Project Blueprint: CryptoGotchi Web Application

## Project Overview

CryptoGotchi is a cutting-edge web application designed to revolutionize the virtual pet gaming industry by leveraging blockchain technology. Built on the Base L2 blockchain, it offers users a unique experience to hatch, raise, and trade CryptoGotchi pets with dynamically generated attributes and rarity. The project intertwines nostalgia with modern blockchain capabilities, enabling crypto-farming, community engagement, and a rich trading ecosystem. The application aims to attract a wide audience by integrating gaming with crypto-economics and social features.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework) for server-side rendering and optimal performance.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: ethers.js for interacting with the Base L2 blockchain and the deployed token contract.
- **State Management**: Redux for managing application state across components.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsive design.
- **Backend (optional for additional features)**: Node.js with Express for custom server-side logic, APIs, and integration with external services.
- **Database**: Firestore or MongoDB for storing user data, pet attributes, and transaction histories.

## Smart Contract Integration

1. **Setup ethers.js**: Integrate ethers.js in the Next.js project to interact with the Base L2 blockchain.
2. **Connect to Token Contract**: Utilize the ethers.js library to connect to the deployed token contract using its address. Ensure methods are available for transferring tokens, querying balances, and listening to events.
3. **Attribute Generation and Management**: Develop or integrate smart contracts for managing pet attributes, breeding logic, and crypto farming algorithms. These contracts should handle random attribute assignment, trait evolution, and resource management for nurturing pets.

## UI/UX Implementation

1. **Dynamic Themes**: Implement seasonal and progress-evolving themes using Tailwind CSS and React context for theme management.
2. **Responsive Design**: Utilize a mobile-first design approach, ensuring the application is accessible and engaging on various devices.
3. **Custom Components**: Develop reusable React components for the UI, such as pet displays, farming status indicators, and interactive menus for trading and breeding.

## User Engagement Features

1. **Referral Programs**: Implement a referral system where users can invite friends and earn rewards based on the newcomer's achievements.
2. **Leaderboards and Competitions**: Create a leaderboard system displaying top players based on pet rarity, achievements, or farming efficiency. Organize competitions with token rewards to encourage participation.
3. **Social Media Integration**: Utilize OAuth for social media integration, allowing users to share achievements, trades, or rare pets on their profiles.

## CryptoGotchi Trading and Farming

1. **Auction System**: Develop an auction component where users can list their pets for sale, place bids, and view auction history.
2. **Trade History and Statistics**: Implement a feature to track and display personal and global trade statistics, including average sale prices and rare pet trades.
3. **Crypto Farming**: Integrate a passive crypto farming mechanism for pets, influenced by their level and rarity. Allow users to convert farmed tokens into pet enhancements directly.

## Community Engagement

1. **In-app Messaging and Forums**: Integrate a real-time messaging service and forums for user interaction, discussion, and community building.
2. **External Social Media Platforms**: Facilitate sharing to external social media platforms directly from the app, enhancing visibility and engagement.

## Testing and Deployment

1. **Unit and Integration Testing**: Employ Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing of components and Redux actions/reducers.
2. **E2E Testing**: Utilize Cypress for end-to-end testing, ensuring all user flows work as expected.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy the application on Vercel, optimizing for Next.js projects, with continuous deployment set up from a GitHub repository.
